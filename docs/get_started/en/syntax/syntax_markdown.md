This article is a document written using `Markdown`, using the page effect generated by `teedoc`, see [here](https://github.com/teedoc/teedoc.github.io/blob/main/docs/ get_started/zh/syntax/syntax_markdown.md)

## Markdown basic file content format

You need to confirm in `site_config.json` that there is a `markdown` parsing plugin enabled, such as `teedoc-plugin-markdown-parser`.

Create a folder or file in the directory corresponding to `config.json`, such as `get_started/zh/syntax/syntax_markdown.md` (`README.md` will eventually generate `index.html`), and then write the content:

### Markdown header

Add a header

```markdown
---
title: markdown syntax
tags: teedoc, markdown, syntax
keywords: teedoc, markdown, syntax
desc: teedoc's markdown syntax introduction and examples
id: zh_readme
class: zh_readme
# comment start with # flag
---
```

Use these keys to set article information:
* `title`: the title of the article
* `keywords`: Keywords, multiple keywords are separated by English commas`,`, will be added to the header of `html`, which is convenient for search engines to crawl, and will not be displayed on the page
* `desc`: page description, which will be added to the header of `html` for easy crawling by search engines
* `tags`: article tags, will be displayed on the page
* `id`: page `id`, will be added to the `html` tag, such as `<html id="zh_readme">...</html>`, it can be left unset, it will overwrite `config.json` Settings in
* `class`: page `class`, multiple separated by English comma`, `, you can not set it, it will overwrite the setting in `config.json`. For example, you can set the `css` style of a specific page by setting this value. Supported classes see [theme plugins' doc](../themes.md)
* `layout`: The layout template used by the page. By default, this key value is not needed. The configuration in the theme plugin will be used. You need to customize the layout of this page. You can set this parameter. The path is relative to the `site_config` layout_root_dir` path, `layout_root_dir` defaults to `layout`, so to use `layout/special_layout.html` only need to fill in `special_layout.html`. See [layout document](../usage/layout_template.md) for layout template syntax

For the more, to add comment in metadata, just add string start with `#` charactor

### Markdown file content

The content is written using the `Markdown` grammar, because the title will be converted into the `<h1>` tag, so the content is recommended to start with the secondary title, so that a page has only one `<h1>` tag, which is convenient for search engines to crawl ,such as
```markdown
---
title: teedoc
keywords: teedoc, markdown, jupyter notebook, html, document generation, alternative gitbook, website generation, static website
desc: teedoc, convert markdown or jupyter notbook into html static webpage
id: zh_readme
class: zh_readme
---


## Title One

content. . .

## Title Two

content. . .
```


The first-level title (`#`) is best not to be used, because the above `title` will automatically generate a first-level title (`<h1>` tag), and a page should have only one first-level title, which is convenient for search engines to crawl Included

`keywords` is the `keywords` of the generated `html` page, which will not be displayed on the page, and is mainly provided to search engines
`desc` is the `description` of the generated `html` page, it will not be displayed on the page, it is mainly provided to search engines
`tags` are the tags for the article, which will be displayed on the page


## Secondary heading

### Three-level heading

#### Four-level heading

#### Four-level heading 2

#### Four-level heading 3

##### Five-level heading

###### Sixth level heading

Up to 6 headings

## Video


```html
<video src="https://****.com/***.mp4" controls="controls" preload="auto">your brower not support play video</video>
```

There is no video here, so it is blank, just put in the correct video and it can be played

<video src="" controls="controls" preload="auto">your brower or site not support play video</video>


## iframe embedded in webpage

<iframe src="//player.bilibili.com/player.html?aid=52613549&bvid=BV144411J72P&cid=92076022&page=1" scrolling="no" border="0" frameborder="no" framespacing="0" allowfullscreen=" true" style="width:43vw;height:34vw;min-width: 85%;"> </iframe>

| Header 1 | *Header* 2 |
| -------- | -------- |
| `Cell 1` | [Cell 2](http://example.com) link |
| Cell 3 | **Cell 4** |

## 标题链接(页内跳转)


e.g.
goto [Markdown header](#Markdown-header), just need
```markdown
[Markdown header](#Markdown-header)
```

Use minus sign `-` to replace space ` `


## HTML

```html
<div class="hello">
hello  <img src="../../assets/images/logo.png"/>
</div>
```

注意这里没有空行, 效果如下

<div class="hello">
hello <br/> <img src="../../assets/images/logo.png"/>
</div>


## math

Supports `tex` and `Latex` syntax, and `MathML` tag

Two ways of writing,
* One is inline inline, wrap the equation with `$` symbol, for example
```markdown
The mass-energy equation $E=mc^2$ is familiar to everyone, right?
```
> Effect:
> Mass-energy equation $E=mc^2$ everyone is familiar with

* Another type, block equation, wrap the equation with `$$`, such as
```markdown
$$
E=mc^2
$$
```
> Effect:
> $$
> E=mc^2
> $$

Other examples:
common:
```markdown
When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ and they are
$$
x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.
$$
```

> When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ and they are
> $$
> x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.
> $$

Division method:

```markdown
$$
\require{enclose}
\begin{array}{r}
                13 \\[-3pt]
4 \enclose{longdiv}{52} \\[-3pt]
     \underline{4}\phantom{2} \\[-3pt]
                12 \\[-3pt]
     \underline{12}\\0
\end{array}\\
$$
```

```markdown
$$
\bbox[#cde, 3px,border:1px solid blue]{y=x^2-1}
$$
```
